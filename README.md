# Video Game Prices (VGP)
---

## Description
---
VGP is my first project, that I have created after graduating from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. The purpose of VGP is the find gamers the lowest possible price on their upcoming purchases. VGP will live both as a standalone website and as a chrome extension, future plans for VGP include creating an ios and android version. VGP accomplishes it's goal of finding the lowest possible prices by searching multiple retailers for a specific game and displaying the prices to the user.
