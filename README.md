# Video Game Prices (VGP)
---

## Description
---
VGP is the first project I have created after graduating from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. The purpose of VGP is the find gamers the lowest possible price on their upcoming purchases. VGP will live both as a standalone website and as a chrome extension, future plans for VGP include creating an ios and android version. VGP accomplishes it's goal of finding prices by displaying prices of a specific game at multiple retailers.
